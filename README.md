# Planktoscope-code
#In this repository you will find processing code for exported files from ecotaxa. These will create outputs for abundance, cell concentration and biovolume.
These codes were written for the Ecotaxa project "Canadian west coast plankton", therefore some naming conventions must be changed when using for other projects.
